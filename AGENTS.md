# AGENTS Instructions

This repository is a simple Telegram bot powered by Pyrogram with OpenAI or Ollama backends.
The main logic now lives in `app.py` and helper functions are in `bot_utils.py`.

* Whenever you modify any Python file, especially `app.py`, run
  `python -m py_compile app.py bot_utils.py ui.py` to ensure there are no syntax errors.
* Use four spaces for indentation.
* Keep commit messages brief but descriptive.
* In pull request summaries, mention the key code changes and summarize
  the result of running the above command.
